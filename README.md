# RPS Portfolio Dashboard

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f6c43398-657a-4ea3-bf4b-692aede87e7e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/rps-portfolio/deploys)

This is a personal stock portfolio display for tracking my quantitative investment strategies. Data are fetched from [rps-portfolio-backend](https://github.com/kanfu-web/rps-portfolio-backend) during build time (portfolio and percent change, updated weekly). Historical price data are downloaded from a Chinese stock analysis and trading software. Analyses like rps calculation are done in python pandas.

**Disclaimer**: I purposefully did not put much stock related information on the page (like how I pick my portfolio or what RPS means). I am not a financial analyst. Content on this website should not be regarded as investment advice.
